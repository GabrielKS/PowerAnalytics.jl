# PowerAnalytics.jl

### Overview

PowerAnalytics.jl is a Julia package designed to support power system simulation results analysis. It relies on results generated from [`PowerSimulations.jl`](https://github.com/NREL-SIIP/PowerSimulations.jl). PowerAnalytics provides the data collection, aggregation, and subsetting for [`PowerGraphics.jl`](https://github.com/nrel-siip/PowerGraphics.jl).

The documentation is still a work in progress.

## Installation

The latest stable release of PowerAnalytics can be installed using the Julia package manager with

```julia
] add PowerAnalytics
```
