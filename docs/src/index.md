# PowerAnalytics.jl

## Overview

PowerAnalytics.jl is a Julia package designed to support power system simulation results analysis. It relies on results generated from [`PowerSimulations.jl`](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSimulations.jl/stable/) and data structures defined in [`PowerSystems.jl`](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSystems.jl/stable/). PowerAnalytics also provides the data collection, aggregation, and subsetting for [`PowerGraphics.jl`](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerGraphics.jl/stable/).

The tutorial, how-to, and explanation sections of the documentation are still under construction; the most informative section is the [public API reference](reference/public.md). PowerAnalytics depends heavily on the `ComponentSelector` feature of PowerSystems.jl, documented [here](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSystems.jl/stable/api/public/#InfrastructureSystems.ComponentSelector).

## Installation

The latest stable release of PowerAnalytics can be installed using the Julia package manager with

```julia
] add PowerAnalytics
```

## About Sienna

`PowerAnalytics.jl` is part of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's
[Sienna ecosystem](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/Sienna/), an open source framework for
power system modeling, simulation, and optimization. The Sienna ecosystem can be
[found on GitHub](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna/Sienna). It contains three applications:

  - [Sienna\Data](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/Sienna/pages/applications/sienna_data.html) enables
    efficient data input, analysis, and transformation
  - [Sienna\Ops](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/Sienna/pages/applications/sienna_ops.html) enables
    enables system scheduling simulations by formulating and solving optimization problems
  - [Sienna\Dyn](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/Sienna/pages/applications/sienna_dyn.html) enables
    system transient analysis including small signal stability and full system dynamic
    simulations

Each application uses multiple packages written in the [`Julia`](http://www.julialang.org)
programming language.
